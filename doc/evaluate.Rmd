One purpose of `distplyr` is to handle the menial distribution-related calculations for you. Just specify a distribution once, and there is no need to manage its components anymore. 

**Example**: want to compute the variance of a Uniform(-1, 1) distribution, get the 0.25- and 0.75-quantiles, and generate a sample of size 10? 

Without `distplyr`:

```{r}
a <- -1
b <- 1
# Look up formula for variance:
(b - a) ^ 2 / 12
# Get quantiles:
qunif(c(0.25, 0.75), min = a, max = b)
# Get sample of size 10:
runif(10, min = a, max = b)
```

With `distplyr`:

```{r}
d <- dst_unif(-1, 1)
variance(d)
eval_quantile(d, at = c(0.25, 0.75))
realise(d, 10)
```


## Functional Representations of a Distribution

A distribution can be represented by different functions, such as a density function, a cumulative distribution function, and others. In `distplyr`, you can: 

- evaluate the function directly by calling `eval_*`;
- evaluate the function and enframe results together with the function arguments with `enframe_*`; or 
- get the function itself using `get_*`. 

Here are the representations and the corresponding `distplyr` functions:  

| Quantity                         | `distplyr` Functions              |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Cumulative Distribution Function | `eval_cdf()`,      `get_cdf()`,      `enframe_cdf()`      |
| Survival Function                | `eval_survival()`, `get_survival()`, `enframe_survival()` |
| Quantile Function                | `eval_quantile()`, `get_quantile()`, `enframe_quantile()` |
| Hazard Function                  | `eval_hazard()`,   `get_hazard()`,   `enframe_hazard()`   |
| Cumulative Hazard Function       | `eval_chf()`,      `get_chf()`,      `enframe_chf()`      |
| Probability density function     | `eval_density()`,  `get_density()`,  `enframe_density()`  |
| Probability mass function        | `eval_pmf()`,      `get_pmf()`,      `enframe_pmf()`      |

These functions all take a distribution object as their first argument, and `eval_*` and `enframe_*` have a second argument named `at` indicating where to evaluate the function. The `at` argument is vectorized.



Here is an example of evaluating the hazard function and the random sample generator of a Uniform(-1,1) distribution, and enframing the density:

```{r}
eval_hazard(d, at = 0:10)
enframe_density(d, at = 0:10)
set.seed(10)
```

`enframe()` works particularly well with tibbles and `tidyr::unnest()`:

```{r}
# half_marathon <- tribble(
# 	~ person, ~ race_time_min,
# 	"Vincenzo", dst_norm(130, 25),
# 	"Colleen", dst_norm(110, 13),
# 	"Regina", dst_norm(115, 20)
# ) 
# half_marathon %>% 
# 	mutate(quartiles = map(race_time_min, enframe_quantile, at = 1:3 / 4)) %>% 
# 	unnest(quartiles)
```


## Drawing a random sample

To draw a random sample from a distribution, use the `realise()` or `realize()` function:

```{r}
realise(d, n = 5)
```

You can read this call as "realise distribution `d` five times". By default, `n` is set to 1, so that realizing a distribution converts it to a numeric draw:

```{r}
realise(d)
```

This default is especially useful when working with distributions in a tibble:

```{r}
# half_marathon %>% 
# 	mutate(actual_time_min = map_dbl(race_time_min, realise))
```

Perhaps surprisingly, distplyr does not consider `realise()` as a functional representation of a distribution, even though random sampling falls into the same family as the `stats::p*/d*/q*/r*` functions. This is because it's impossible to perfectly describe a distribution based on a sample. 


## Properties of Distributions

Distributions have various numeric properties. Common examples are the mean and variance, but there are many others as well. 

Below is a table of the properties incorporated in `distplyr`:

| Property | `distplyr` Function |
|----------|---------------------|
| Mean                       | `mean()` |
| Median                     | `median()` |
| Variance                   | `variance()` |
| Standard Deviation         | `sd()` |
| Skewness                   | `skewness()` |
| Excess Kurtosis            | `kurtosis_exc()` |
| Kurtosis                   | `kurtosis_raw()` |
| Extreme Value (Tail) Index | `evi()` |

Here are some properties of our original Uniform(-1, 1) distribution:

```{r}
mean(d)
stdev(d)
evi(d)
```
